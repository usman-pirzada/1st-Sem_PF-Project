### Abstract

The Inventory Management System will be designed to manage product stock levels, track orders, and generate comprehensive reports on inventory and sales status. The system will streamline inventory tracking by automating updates for stock orders and item statuses. This tool will help businesses ensure they have accurate information on their available products, thus optimizing order processing and avoiding stockouts.

The proposed project will incorporate core programming techniques such as functions, pointers, arrays, and loops, ensuring efficient data handling.
